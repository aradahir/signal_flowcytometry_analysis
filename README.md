# signal_flowcytometry_analysis

A program for detecting cells based on fluorescent tagging from custom portable flow cytometry platform. 

# General info

This project is developed for immunofluorescence detection of rare blood typing using the portable flow cytometry. It includes signal processing for quantifying the signal from cells 
and the visualization of assay development comparison between standard agglutination, commercial flow cytometry, and custom flow cytometry.

# Technologies
This project created with:

1. Python version >=3.6 for visualization
2. MATLAB 2017a with signal processing tool box.

# Run
Installation the program under MATLAB environment.
